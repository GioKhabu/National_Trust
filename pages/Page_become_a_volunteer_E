<h2 align="center">Become a volunteer</h2><div>One of the core objectives of the National Trust of Georgia is to cultivate a strong culture of volunteering. Volunteers are the driving force behind our rehabilitation efforts. While past projects have established a dedicated team, new volunteers are always welcome. We have meaningful work for every skill set, so share your information with us, and weâ€™ll reach out when opportunities arise!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><div><img src="https://nationaltrustofgeorgia.org.ge/img/pages/im_1733853312806923.jpg"></div><br><div><img src="https://nationaltrustofgeorgia.org.ge/img/pages/im_1733853325002955.jpg"></div></div>
