<p data-start="2226" data-end="2937"><em data-start="2226" data-end="2865">"This project is a vivid example of the vital importance of international support and European partnerships in safeguarding our cultural heritage. The involvement of British, French, and Polish colleagues, alongside Georgian specialists and young volunteers, was instrumental in saving this medieval defensive tower—a part of our history and an important monument of European cultural heritage. Beyond restoration, the project raised awareness of the Arkhoti community in both Georgia and Europe, created strong foundations for heritage tourism in the region, and fostered friendships between Georgian and European youth and volunteers,"</em> said <strong data-start="2871" data-end="2891">Marine Mizandari</strong>, co-founder of the National Trust of Georgia.</p>
