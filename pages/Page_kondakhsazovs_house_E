<h3>General overview of the building</h3><div>In October 2017 the Trust took over a unique, unusually unmolested 18th -19th-century property in the Metekhi cliffs area of the city, adjoining Avlabari. The property is large enough to act as the Trustâ€™s headquarters permanently, as well as contain space for exhibitions, events and offices. Like other properties in Georgia, this three-story building was in a poor state of repair, but it has now been beautifully restored. It is being used as an example for locals of how building repair can be done on budget, effectively and with historic sensitivity, in their own houses. There will be an exhibition in the building illustrating overall progress.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="http://nationaltrustofgeorgia.org.ge/img/pages/im_1727462454005783.jpg"></div><div><p><img src="http://nationaltrustofgeorgia.org.ge/img/pages/im_1727462963305178.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://nationaltrustofgeorgia.org.ge/img/pages/im_1727462989359316.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://nationaltrustofgeorgia.org.ge/img/pages/im_1727463005661560.jpg"></p><p><img src="/img/pages/im_1731583121112480.jpg"></p><p><img src="/img/pages/im_1731583129454285.jpg"></p></div>
