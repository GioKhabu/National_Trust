<h3>House with arches in Kbode neighborhood</h3><div>In October 2017 the Trust took over a unique, unusually unmolested 18th -19th-century property in the historic Isani, Metekhi cliffs area of the city - Kbode. Like other properties in Georgia, this three-story building was in a poor state of repair, but it has now been beautifully restored. The project was realized with the professional service of ICOMOS Georgia and financial support of the Swedish embassy in Georgia.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><img src="http://nationaltrustofgeorgia.org.ge/img/pages/im_1727462454005783.jpg"></div><div><p><img src="http://nationaltrustofgeorgia.org.ge/img/pages/im_1727462963305178.jpg" class=""></p><p>The restoration went with slow and coherent processes.
