<p data-start="116" data-end="648">The application was submitted by her relative, Nani Bendeliani, for a house that is over a century old. The house was built before the establishment of the Lentekhi district, making it one of the oldest surviving homes in the area. Most similar dwellings nearby have either been destroyed or severely damaged. The owner is fully aware of the house’s value, feels a strong sense of personal responsibility, and, to the best of her ability, preserves the original details of the house in their untouched state using her own resources.</p><p data-start="116" data-end="648"><img width="223px;" height="297px;" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/slidesz/AGV_vUfqZFrWm0WVX0FENI_U6Kqf0jv2PJXKAJX2j35at0gx-tfSXyN87j_3eqMpZOOIYrF5a8WzYJk2mARAN3MB26S1laHHnxxdcyUY63TUOJLYmnjE4c1fZNrboSY5SHuUXaCuwQQU=s2048?key=gVgaXPs-xgZ4kdAOE7QEug" title="WhatsApp Image 2025-05-04 at 20.16.16.jpeg" style="width: 665px;"><img width="395px;" height="297px;" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/slidesz/AGV_vUe0k0KMhHBXZMbf0Bf12PFH62FCE505T0OzpyIguWgSwCilkDBqBGNYe9f8YjMBAdMInsygCDb1zvECXBq7MXOVaUZQZzLkCbunX1XVbU5YLL_bBPHpSbAv2-ilvS-4qjBXvrg=s2048?key=gVgaXPs-xgZ4kdAOE7QEug" title="WhatsApp Image 2025-05-04 at 20.16.17 (1).jpeg" style="width: 665px;"></p><p data-start="59" data-end="115"><strong data-start="59" data-end="115">3rd Place – Nika Dzagania – Samegrelo, Village Balda</strong></p><p data-start="117" data-end="518">Nika returned to his 130-year-old ancestral home in the village of Balda, Martvili Municipality, Samegrelo, and transformed it into a tourism space.

The foundation of the fireplace serves as the central structural pillar of the house, crafted from a mixture of stone and clay. The house features a beautifully carved wooden balcony.

</p><p data-start="495" data-end="1072">The interior features a display of photographs that tell the story of the family, effectively turning the house into a museum. The owner hopes that his respectful attitude toward heritage will serve as an example to others, especially in a context where many historic houses in the area are being disfigured or demolished. As he notes, current residents often lack sufficient knowledge and education about heritage preservation. His motivation for participating in the contest was to show those around him that such respect for heritage can and should be recognized and valued.</p><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; line-height: 1.38;"><img src="https://www.nationaltrustofgeorgia.org.ge/img/pages/im_1749122846366071.jpg" style="width: 665px;"></p><div><img width="414px;" height="310px;" src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/slidesz/AGV_vUd_3ghP64ARMC6QqVcQsfHYSuBfIdMVh1nauIAKjOdYR9eaPQpMxpePr415Vhbh6WLtlugMxeQSIvjxdVNKboimpmLr6KuLL9BbSCyPbpkXHj0Q1IsNYapPZSdmHd7LKBk0HMZA=s2048?key=gVgaXPs-xgZ4kdAOE7QEug" title="2-2 - Dimitri Kemoklidze.jpeg" style="width: 665px;"></div><div><p data-start="59" data-end="136"><strong data-start="59" data-end="136">1st Place – Lili Fulariani – Imereti, Baghdati Municipality, Village Dimi</strong></p>
