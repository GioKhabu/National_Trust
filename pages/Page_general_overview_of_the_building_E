<h2 align="center">general_overview_of_the_building</h2><div>In October 2017 the Trust took over a unique, unusually unmolested 18th -19th century property in the Metekhi cliffs area of the city, adjoining Avlabari. The property is large enough to act as the Trustâ€™s headquarters on a permanent basis, as well as contain space for exhibitions, events and offices. Like so many properties in Georgia this three story building was in a poor stage of repair, but it has now been beautifully restored and is being used as an example for locals as to how building repair can be done cheaply, effectively and with historic sensitivity, on their own homes. There will be an exhibition inside the building illustrating how this is achieved.</div><div><br></div><div><img src="http://nationaltrustofgeorgia.org.ge/img/pages/im_1727462454005783.jpg"></div><div><p><img src="http://nationaltrustofgeorgia.org.ge/img/pages/im_1727462963305178.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://nationaltrustofgeorgia.org.ge/img/pages/im_1727462989359316.jpg"></p><p><img src="http://nationaltrustofgeorgia.org.ge/img/pages/im_1727463005661560.jpg"></p></div>
